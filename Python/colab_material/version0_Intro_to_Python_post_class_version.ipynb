In the field of bioinformatics, Python is also widely used in computational programming, data analysis, and pipeline development. \n","\n","Below we have listed some examples where Python-based tools are used:\n","\n","| **Example use case** | **Tool** |\n","| :---: | :---: |\n","| Pipeline development | [bcbio](https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) |\n","| Image analysis | [CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org/) |\n","| Molecular visualization | [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/) |\n","| Machine learning | [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) |\n","\n","> Note: Many bioinformatics tools are written in Python, and you may have encountered/used them without knowing how they work.

It is rapidly gaining popularity for collaborative research and teaching (so, you may encounter it again soon!).\n","\n","If you would like to use Python offline though, you will need to install Python on your computer. Python can be downloaded and installed from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The latest release version is Python 3.8 (as of June 2020), and it is recommended that you install the latest version.\n","\n","After Python is installed, there are multiple platforms where you can run Python code.

Jupyter Notebook/JupyterLab: [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application for interactive computing. It allows users to create and share documents that contain code, equations, plots and narrative text. Since Colab is based on the Jupyter notebook environment, we have checked it out in this workshop already. The extension of the notebook file is always `.ipynb`. JupyterLab is a next-generation version of Jupyter Notebook, just with some improvements. You can install them from [here](https://jupyter.org/install).\n","2. Spyder: [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) is an open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for scientific programming in Python. It offers a combination of script editing, data analysis, debugging, and visualization. If you are already used to coding in an IDE interface, like RStudio or Matlab, you will find that using Spyder is very familiar and intuitive.\n","3. **(Recommended)** Anaconda: many Python users would use a one-stop-shop package manager like [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/). Just to note, Anaconda allows users to launch applications and manage conda packages, environments and channels without using command-line commands. After installing Anaconda, you can access its desktop graphical user interface (GUI), the Anaconda Navigator. Applications like Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, and Spyder are by default installed and are available on it.
